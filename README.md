This repository contains two structured datasets designed to analyze customer behavior and feedback:
Customer Journey Data

      Tracks step-by-step interactions of customers with products.
      Includes key fields such as JourneyID, CustomerID, ProductID, VisitDate, Stage, Action, and Duration.
      Useful for analyzing funnel progression, stage conversion rates, and drop-off points.

Customer Reviews Data

      Captures post-purchase feedback from customers.
      Includes ReviewID, CustomerID, ProductID, ReviewDate, Rating, and ReviewText.
      Enables sentiment analysis, product satisfaction tracking, and linking reviews to journey behavior.

Purpose:
The combination of both datasets allows for end-to-end analysis of customer experience â€” from initial awareness and consideration through to purchase and post-purchase sentiment.

Potential Use Cases:

      Funnel analysis and drop-off detection.
      Customer engagement and duration tracking.
      Correlating journey behavior with review ratings.
      Generating business insights to improve conversion and satisfaction.
