# Marketing Analytics with SQL

This project demonstrates SQL-based data cleaning, enrichment, and analysis for marketing and customer journey data. It uses the PortfolioProject_MarketingAnalytics database and explores customer demographics, engagement, funnel analysis, time-to-purchase, and review trends.

# Project Overview

The goal of this project is to transform raw marketing data into actionable insights using SQL queries. The exercises cover:

      Data enrichment: Joining customer and geography data.

      Product insights: Categorizing products into price tiers.

      Engagement cleaning: Standardizing content types, parsing views/clicks, formatting dates.

      Deduplication: Identifying and resolving duplicate records with ROW_NUMBER().

      Customer journey analytics: Funnel retention, action frequency, visit timelines, and time-to-purchase.

      Engagement metrics: Average session duration and repeat visits.

      Review insights: Rating distribution, trends over time, and relationship between engagement and satisfaction.

      Conversion rate analysis: Funnel-wide conversion rate to purchase/checkout.

# SQL Techniques Used

      Joins (LEFT, INNER, FULL OUTER) for enrichment.

      CASE expressions for conditional categorization.

      String manipulation (REPLACE, UPPER, LEFT, RIGHT, CHARINDEX).

      Date functions (FORMAT, DATEPART, CONVERT).

      Window functions (ROW_NUMBER(), LAG(), AVG() OVER, PARTITION BY).

      Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for deduplication and funnel analysis.

      Aggregations (COUNT, AVG, SUM, GROUP BY).
